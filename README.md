Check that no globals are present in Go code.

## Why

Global variables are an input to functions that is not visible in the functions signature, complicate testing, reduces readability and increase the complexity of code.

### Exceptions

There are very few exceptions to the global variable rule. This tool will ignore the following patterns:
 * Variables with an `Err` prefix
 * Variables named `_`
 * Variables named `version`

## Install

```
go get 4d63.com/gochecknoglobals
```

## Usage

```
gochecknoglobals
```

```
gochecknoglobals ./...
```

```
gochecknoglobals [path] [path] [path] [etc]
```

Add `-t` to include tests.

```
gochecknoglobals -t [path]
```

Note: Paths are only inspected recursively if the Go `/...` recursive path suffix is appended to the path.
